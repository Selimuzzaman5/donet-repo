          Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that you’re
          helping others is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel
          happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between
          making a donation to charity and increased activity in the area of the
          brain that registers pleasure - proving that as the old adage goes, it
          really is far better to give than to receive. <br />
          Our own research into why people give supports this. We asked 700 of
          our generous donors to tell us what motivates them to give regularly
          to charity; 42% agreed the enjoyment they receive from giving as a key
          influence.

            Having the power to improve the lives of others is, to many people,
            a privilege, and one that comes with its own sense of obligation.
            Acting on these powerful feelings of responsibility is a great way
            to reinforce our own personal values and feel like we’re living in a
            way that is true to our own.

            Many people are concerned that their donations to charity may be
            reduced by tax or administrative costs, preventing the full amount
            from reaching the people or causes they really want to help.
            Thankfully there are ways to make the most of every donation to
            charity.

            Your own charitable donations can inspire your nearest and dearest
            to give to causes important to them, and could even bring about a
            family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special
            significance to you as a group

          Many people give to charity on a regular basis, because they either
          like to make a difference, have a positive impact on others or just
          because it makes them feel good about themselves. But did you know
          that there are studies that show, giving to charity carries its own
          health and wellbeing benefits and it also has positive effects on your
          personal lives?
